Program Educational Objectives
The ACU engineering program strongly supports the university’s mission of educating students for Christian service and leadership throughout the world. In support of the university mission and in response to the needs of program constituents, the Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) are that within a few years of graduation:
Alumni are succeeding in engineering practice or other diverse fields that value analytical, problem solving, and professional practice skills.
Alumni are engaging in life-long learning that builds upon foundational knowledge acquired in their undergraduate education through graduate study, career-specific training, or other professional training.
Alumni are glorifying God through thoughtful integration of work and life, facilitating service to others through their profession.
Student Outcomes
The following student outcomes will prepare ACU engineering students to attain the program educational objectives:
An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.
An ability to design and conduct experiments as well as to analyze and interpret data.
An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.
An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams.
An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
An ability to communicate effectively.
The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.
A recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning.
A knowledge of contemporary issues.

BSE: Engineering (ENGR)
Abilene Christian University offers a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree (BSE) with concentrations in civil, electrical, industrial, and mechanical engineering. The engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (www.abet.org).
General Departmental Requirements
Engineering majors must develop mathematical skills as well as design, experimental, and computational abilities. If the student does not qualify to take Precalculus II (MATH 124) when the student enters ACU, his or her graduation may be delayed.
Program Educational Objectives
The ACU engineering program strongly supports the university’s mission of educating students for Christian service and leadership throughout the world. In support of the university mission and in response to the needs of program constituents, the Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) are that within a few years of graduation:
Alumni are succeeding in engineering practice or other diverse fields that value analytical, problem solving, and professional practice skills.
Alumni are engaging in life-long learning that builds upon foundational knowledge acquired in their undergraduate education through graduate study, career-specific training, or other professional training.
Alumni are glorifying God through thoughtful integration of work and life, facilitating service to others through their profession.
Student Outcomes
The following student outcomes will prepare ACU engineering students to attain the program educational objectives:
An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.
An ability to design and conduct experiments as well as to analyze and interpret data.
An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.
An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams.
An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
An ability to communicate effectively.
The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.
A recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning.

BS: Environmental Science Degree Plan (ENVR)
The purpose of this degree is to fulfill the educational needs of students who are preparing for careers in natural resource management. As the national consciousness of the finite nature of natural resources has increased, the extraction industries, agriculture and manufacturers in general have been required to change the way they handle natural resources. Interactions between companies that consume natural resources and regulations governing the conservation of these resources have led to the creation of new disciplines and new career opportunities. Graduate schools in colleges of agriculture as well as in colleges of arts and sciences offer degrees and graduate assistantships in a multitude of environmental areas. The emergence of new jobs in natural resource management indicates the opportunities for graduates in environmental science.

Major: Environmental Science, Wildlife and Natural Resource Management, BS (ENVR-ENVW)
URL: https://catalog.acu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=6096&returnto=705
BS: Environmental Science Degree Plan (ENVR)
The purpose of this degree is to fulfill the educational needs of students who are preparing for careers in natural resource management. As the national consciousness of the finite nature of natural resources has increased, the extraction industries, agriculture and manufacturers in general have been required to change the way they handle natural resources. Interactions between companies that consume natural resources and regulations governing the conservation of these resources have led to the creation of new disciplines and new career opportunities. Graduate schools in colleges of agriculture as well as in colleges of arts and sciences offer degrees and graduate assistantships in a multitude of environmental areas. The emergence of new jobs in natural resource management indicates the opportunities for graduates in environmental science.
