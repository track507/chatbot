URL: https://catalog.acu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=20&poid=9742&returnto=1157
BS: Environmental Science Degree Plan (ENVR)
The purpose of this degree is to fulfill the educational needs of students who are preparing for careers in natural resource management. As the national consciousness of the finite nature of natural resources has increased, the extraction industries, agriculture and manufacturers in general have been required to change the way they handle natural resources. Interactions between companies that consume natural resources and regulations governing the conservation of these resources have led to the creation of new disciplines and new career opportunities. Graduate schools in colleges of agriculture as well as in colleges of arts and sciences offer degrees and graduate assistantships in a multitude of environmental areas. The emergence of new jobs in natural resource management indicates the opportunities for graduates in environmental science.
